# this program introduces "print()." The functions wants you to put some text in the inside of the () using ''.
# don't get it just yet? just copy the text above, replace the "Hello World" text with your own, and then run it!
# this code also introduces comments, which are started by an "#." They don't affect your code, and will be used to explain a bit more about any given line of code.
# by using a variable to generate the code and using it, it will print out whatever is defined the variable. more complex, but still works!
